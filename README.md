# Cyberpunk 2077: Context-Aware Generative Texting

This project creates a bridge between **Cyberpunk 2077's internal game state** (Redscript engine) and **Large Language Models** (LLMs). While standard generative mods allow for generic conversation, this system injects real-time, high-fidelity context—Quest Objectives, Police Heat Levels, and Weather Conditions—into the LLM's system prompt, allowing companions to react dynamically to the player's immediate reality.

## The Difference: Context Matters

Standard LLM integration often feels disconnected from gameplay. This system fixes that by injecting the player's active Quest and current Objective into the prompt pipeline.

| **Standard Generative AI** | **Context-Aware System** |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![No Context](Images/NoContextMessage.png)<br>Witout quest context the character seems unaware of the world. | ![With Context](Images/WithContextMessage.png)<br>With the quest "Riders on the Storm" being tracked the character knows the current state of the world. |


## Features & Event Systems

### 1. Dynamic "Heat" Reactivity
The system hooks into the `PreventionSystem` to detect changes in police pursuit levels. It calculates a probability curve based on the threat level (1 Star = Low probability, 5 Stars = 100% probability) to trigger organic reactions.

| **Low Heat (Level 1)** | **Maximum Heat (Level 5)** |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Heat Level 1](Images/PoliceEventHeatLvl1.png)<br> Casual warning about minor trouble. | ![Heat Level 5](Images/PoliceEventHeatLvl5.png)<br> Urgent, high-stakes reaction. |

To prevent annoyance during minor accidental crimes, the companion's reaction chance scales with the threat level:
  - ★ (1 Star)	20%	Low probability. Minor trouble is often ignored.
  - ★★ (2 Stars)	40%	Moderate probability.
  - ★★★ (3 Stars)	70%	High probability. The situation is getting serious.
  - ★★★★ (4 Stars)	90%	Very High probability.
  - ★★★★★ (5 Stars)	100%	Guaranteed Reaction. MaxTac is involved; the situation is critical.


### 2. Environmental Awareness (Weather Monitor)
Using a custom **Polling Monitor Pattern** (to bypass native API limitations), the system tracks changes in `worldRainIntensity`.
* **Light Rain:** Triggers low-priority warnings.
* **Heavy Rain:** Triggers comments on visibility and driving safety.

Companions will comment on visibility or toxicity, but not every time it sprinkles:
  - Light Rain: 25% Chance to comment.
  - Heavy Storms: 75% Chance to comment (High Priority).

### 3. Location-Based Invitations (Player Location)
The system tracks V's movement across Night City districts. If you enter a district containing a key location (like a bar associated with a companion), there is a chance they will invite you out. This makes the city feel lived-in and social.
By hooking to the `PreventionSystem` like the Heat Event,but hooked into `OnDistrictAreaEntered`. Companions will invite you to a bar with a 5% chance.

| **Dark Matter Bar** | **Lizzie's Bar** |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Dark Matter](Images/BarInvitationDarkMatter.png)<br> Companion inviting you to the VIP club. | ![Lizzie's Bar](Images/BarInvitationLizzies.png)<br> Companion noticing you are in Kabuki and inviting you to Lizzie's. |


## Under the Hood: Prompt Engineering

To ensure the LLM adheres to the game's narrative, I engineered structured prompt templates that update dynamically based on game state.

### The "Quest Context" Template
This logic resides in `ContextDataSystem.reds`. It maps raw quest titles to narrative summaries to ensure the AI understands the *stakes*, not just the objective.

```text
MISSION: Riders on the Storm. CONTEXT: My leader, Saul, has been kidnapped by the Wraiths.They are holding him at their camp in Sierra Sonora.
We are currently in the middle of a rescue operation.I am terrified of losing him but trying to stay focused.
There is a dust storm approaching which gives us cover but adds urgency.
CURRENT SITUATION: We are currently:Meet with Panam.React to V based on this specific situation.
```

### The "Weather Event" Template
```text
[SYSTEM EVENT: [ENVIRONMENT EVENT: Heavy storm or hazardous rain detected. Low visibility. Warn V to drive carefully.]] V: *System Update* 
```

### The "Police Event" Template
```text
[INSTRUCTION: You are roleplaying. V just gained police heat. Send V a text message reacting to this.DO NOT output the heat level. DO NOT output your mood. DO NOT output your name. Output ONLY the text message body.
Context: "Heat 1 – Mild concern. A light, cautious reaction. You notice the trouble but stay composed.Tone: wary, slightly annoyed, or amused, depending on your personality.
```

### The "District Event" Template
```text
[INSTRUCTION: You are roleplaying. V has just entered the district where you where there is a bar.Send V a casual text message inviting them to join you or if they want to hangout in the future for a drink at the bar. Keep it short and natural. Output location name in your setence for V to know where to meet. Output ONLY the text message body.
Context: Location: Lizzie's Bar (The Mox hangout). Atmosphere: Neon, chaotic, loud braindance music. Tone: Energetic, fun, or cheeky. Mention the vibe.
```

## Core Systems
ContextDataSystem (Passive Data Layer):
  - Responsible for extracting raw data (Quest Title, Weather Enum, Heat Int).
  - Formats raw data into human-readable Prompt Snippets.
  - Contains the "Hardcoded Mapper" for Quest Context to ensure 100% narrative consistency on key missions.

ContextEventManager (Active Logic Layer):
  - Weather Monitor: Implements a resource-efficient 5-second polling loop to detect weather changes (adapting to the lack of a public RegisterListener API).
  - Safety Lock (IsPlayerBusy): Checks scene_tier and is_in_dialogue flags. If V is in a cutscene, incoming messages are snoozed  ensuring the mod never interrupts narrative moments.

GenerativeTextingHttpRequests (Network Layer):
  - Handles the async API calls to OpenAI/Stable Horde.
  - Injects the pendingContext payload generated by the Event Manager.

## OpenRouter Support Added 

Now you can use this mod with the OpenRouter API (https://openrouter.ai/).
Configure the api and model in the GenerativeTextingUtilities.reds
